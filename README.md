A character level RNN to generate short novel stories

## Examples

Here an example after i trained the network for about 1 hour.

```
It rover ove itin cof tin son merk onghter onge tho sou be ptic the save miven to eeralin tho moung his toflecbat noull sthere rea porpos terase an itho stare als the ceedner, heo uhe pee hithice fone ollikk oad sor int can orleoan.```
```

> If you want to get more meaningful result, you should should use technique like word2vec to get a word level input and train a word level RNN to do this job.
